## App Details

This app is the ideal tool to see which areas are the safest and where the police is most active. If you are house hunting, a tourist or simply just curious you’ll be able to have a good idea of which location is safest and where the force is tackling the problems most effectively in England and Wales. 

You can search by location or just navigating the map

The figures are updated on a monthly basis by the National Policing Improvement Agency. 

You can select the period you are interested in, verifying the current status of the investigation.
