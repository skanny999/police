The College have been robust in their dealings with the students, including enforcing a no smoking policy with College staff  patrolling the streets in the immediate vicinity of the College, to intercept and identity youths who may be from their College who commit anti-social acts;  the College have been robust in their application of their tiered approach to discipline students with a proven willingness by the College to expel students; additionally the College have been closing the main gates leading onto Regent Road since early October between 09:30 and 3:30 pm. There were also incidents of people parking on double yellow lines so, we have worked with the College co-authoring letters that we sent to all parents, advising them of the parking prohibitions in the locality; we have utilised the services of the City parking wardens to enforce transgressions of the double yellow lines on West Walk; There are also plans in progress to introduce some CCTV on the street to monitor the West Walk area.
